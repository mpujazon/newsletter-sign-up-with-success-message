## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned about CSS positioning and styling, as well as JavaScript events. I also finally learned how to use the `<picture>` element properly."

```html
<picture>
      <source media="(min-width: 1080px)" srcset="desktop.svg">
      <img src="/mobile.svg" alt="Newsletter illustration">
</picture>
```

### Continued development

In future projects, I would like to start using a component-oriented JavaScript framework.
